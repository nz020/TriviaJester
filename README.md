## App Idea

We want to develop a streak based Quiz App, using the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). \
The app will feature multiple quiz categories and a statistics page where you can see data like your fastest quiz rundown, or longest streak of correct answers. 
Everytime you play you get the option to choose between 4 random categories.


For a quick insight into the apps structure we've made this quick [prototype](https://imgur.com/a/mpa7dnC).
